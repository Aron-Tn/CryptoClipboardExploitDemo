# CryptoClipboardExploitDemo 🛡️

## About the Project
CryptoClipboardExploitDemo is an educational tool 🎓 designed to demonstrate how clipboard hijacker malware 🕵️‍♂️ can manipulate cryptocurrency wallet addresses during transactions. This project aims to raise awareness 🚨 about this type of cyber threat and demonstrate preventive measures.

### Disclaimer
This content is for educational purposes only 🏫. The demonstration and code provided are intended to enhance cybersecurity awareness and should not be used for malicious purposes.

## Features
- **Simulation Script**: `script.py` simulates the behavior of Clipboard Hijacker Malware.
- **Build Script**: `setup.py` uses cx_Freeze to convert the Python script into C code format, preparing it for compilation.

## Getting Started 🚀
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x 🐍
- cx_Freeze 🧊
- NSIS 📦

### Installation and Building
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CryptoClipboardExploitDemo.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install cx_Freeze
   ```
3. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   py -3 setup.py build
   ```
4. Compile with NSIS to create a single executable file.

## Usage
After building, run the generated executable 🖥️ to see how clipboard data can be monitored and altered for cryptocurrency addresses.

## Video Tutorial

For a comprehensive walkthrough of the CryptoClipboardExploitDemo project, check out our video tutorial on YouTube. This video provides a step-by-step guide on how the clipboard hijacker malware operates, demonstrating the actual process of how cryptocurrency wallet addresses can be manipulated during transactions. 

The video also covers the following key topics:
- **Understanding the Threat**: Learn about the mechanics behind clipboard hijacking and why it poses a significant risk to cryptocurrency holders.
- **Prevention Strategies**: Discover practical steps and measures you can take to protect your digital assets from this type of cyber threat.
- **Project Demonstration**: See the CryptoClipboardExploitDemo in action, showing how the scripts and tools we've developed can be used to simulate and study clipboard hijacker malware.

Watching this tutorial will give you valuable insights into both the threat itself and our project's approach to demonstrating and mitigating it.
