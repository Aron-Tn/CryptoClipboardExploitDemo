# CryptoClipboardExploitDemo

## About the Project
CryptoClipboardExploitDemo is an educational tool designed to demonstrate how clipboard hijacker malware can manipulate cryptocurrency wallet addresses during transactions. This project aims to raise awareness about this type of cyber threat and demonstrate preventive measures.

### Disclaimer
This content is for educational purposes only. The demonstration and code provided are intended to enhance cybersecurity awareness and should not be used for malicious purposes.

## Features
- **Simulation Script**: `script.py` simulates the behavior of Clipboard Hijacker Malware.
- **Build Script**: `setup.py` uses cx_Freeze to convert the Python script into C code format, preparing it for compilation.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- cx_Freeze
- NSIS

### Installation and Building
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CryptoClipboardExploitDemo.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install cx_Freeze
   ```
3. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   py -3 setup.py build
   ```
4. Compile with NSIS to create a single executable file.

## Usage
After building, run the generated executable to see how clipboard data can be monitored and altered for cryptocurrency addresses.
